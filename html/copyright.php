            The crawlers of dilandau.com continuously crawl internet every day so
            that users can enjoy their favorite music. We are, however, primarily an
            information location tool, and we maintain no editorial oversight over
            the links in our search index. We do not control the third party
            websites contained in our index. We are not a "file sharing" site, peer
            to peer or otherwise related; and we in no way support or endorse
            illegal copying of music. Because we do not own or have editorial
            control over these third party sites, it is possible that our index may
            link to some music files that were posted without the copyright owner's
            authorization.
        </p>
        <p>
            We rely on copyright owners to protect their own copyright interests by
            communicating with us. We will immediately take down the link in
            response to a valid notice of alleged infringement submitted under the
            Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"). We urge copyright owners to
            directly contact any third party website that has posted an infringing
            music file. The link in the dilandau index only points to the location of
            the file hosted elsewhere on the web. Accordingly, while dilandau can and
            does delete the link from its search engine upon request, it does not,
            because it cannot, delete the infringing file, which was posted and is
            hosted on the Internet by a third party over which dilandau has no control.
            We recommend that you use our search engine to identify the third party
            who posted and is hosting the infringing file, and to contact that
            third party to delete the infringing music file itself from the Internet
            prior to having us remove the link.

            It is our policy to respond immediately to clear notices of alleged
            copyright infringement. This page describes the information that should
            be present in these notices. This procedure is designed to make
            submitting notices of alleged infringement to dilandau as straightforward
            as possible, while reducing the number of notices that we receive that
            are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice
            specified below is consistent with the form required by the United
            States law (an official summary of which can be found at the U.S.
            Copyright Office Web Site,
            http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf), but we will respond to
            notices of this form from other jurisdictions as well. We suggest that
            you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice. Also, please be
            aware that there are penalties (including costs and attorney's fees) for
            false claims under the DMCA. See <a href="http://www.chillingeffects.org/dmca512/faq.cgi" rel="nofollow">http://www.chillingeffects.org/dmca512/faq.cgi</a>

            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and
        attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that a product or
        activity infringes one of your copyrights. Accordingly, if you are not
        sure whether your material is protected by copyright laws, we suggest
        that you first seek the assistance of an attorney.
